# TripAdvisor-Clone-Beginner
Welcome to the TripAdvisor Clone project! This beginner-level project, created using HTML and CSS, aims to mimic the basic layout and design of the TripAdvisor website.
It features a responsive design, a navigation bar, a search bar, sections for popular destinations, top-rated hotels, and user reviews, and a basic footer with links to social media and contact information. To use, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and open the index.html file in your web browser. The project structure includes an index.html file, a style.css file, and an images directory for images.
